Hi, I am Ayush Kumar

I am a **Data Science professional** with a passion for building intelligent, data-driven systems that bridge the gap between theoretical research and real-world applications. My journey into data science began with a strong foundation in **Computer Science and Engineering** (B.Tech., First Division with Honours, CGPA 9.021) at Echelon Institute of Technology, and has evolved into a specialized focus through my **M.Tech. in Data Science** at the **Defence Institute of Advanced Technology, Pune** (CGPA 9.0).  

Over the years, I have developed expertise across the **machine learning ecosystem**, spanning:  
- **Core Concepts**: Supervised & unsupervised learning, deep learning architectures, NLP, computer vision, time-series forecasting, and statistical modelling.  
- **Specialized Areas**: Generative AI, federated learning, physics-informed models, vector similarity search, A/B testing, and feature engineering.  
- **Practical Skills**: Python, SQL, C, Java, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Plotly, Tableau, Streamlit, Docker, MySQL, MongoDB, and API integration.  

## Research & Academic Contributions
My research is driven by the belief that data science should not only be cutting-edge but also grounded in real-world constraints. For my masterâ€™s thesis, I developed a **Physics-Informed Diffusion-Based Framework for Enhancing Underwater Images in High Turbidity Conditions**, combining **deep learning** with **physical modelling** to address challenges in marine imaging. I have also published in peer-reviewed venues, including the **National Conference on Communications (NCC 2025)**, where I presented work on the **performance of state-of-the-art underwater image enhancement models**.  

## Industry Experience
- **ABB Corporate Research Center (Janâ€“June 2025)** â€“ Designed frameworks for **efficient machine learning in resource-constrained environments**, enhanced **collaborative learning in federated settings**, and optimized models for **data privacy and computational efficiency**.  
- **FrugalX (Janâ€“May 2023)** â€“ Built an **image similarity search framework** using artificial neural networks and **Milvus**, integrated **MySQL databases** for fast retrieval, and optimized large-scale image search systems for commercial use.  

## Projects & Applications
- **Wildlife Conservation in CÃ´te dâ€™Ivoire** â€“ Classified animal species from camera trap images.  
- **Crop Disease Detection in Uganda** â€“ CNN-based crop disease classification using transfer learning.  
- **Medical Data Generation in Spain** â€“ GANs to synthesize medical images (X-rays, MRIs).  
- **Social Media Meme Generator** â€“ Stable diffusion model deployed on Streamlit.  
- **Volatility Forecasting in India** â€“ GARCH model for asset volatility prediction.  
- **Earthquake Damage Prediction in Nepal** â€“ Logistic regression & decision trees for risk assessment.  

## Achievements
- **Qualified GATE 2023 (CS)** with a score of 513.  
- Recipient of the **Directorâ€™s Award** at Echelon Institute of Technology.
