# Selected Projects

## Wildlife Conservation in Côte d’Ivoire
Developed advanced neural network models to classify animal species from camera trap images, aiding scientists in tracking wildlife populations.

## Crop Disease Detection in Uganda
Built a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify crop diseases into five categories, improving accuracy using transfer learning and callbacks.

## Traffic Monitoring in Bangladesh
Extended object detection models to process real-time video feeds, detecting vehicles and pedestrians for urban traffic analysis.

## GAN-Based Medical Imaging in Spain
Designed GANs to generate synthetic medical images for training augmentation; deployed with Streamlit.

## Meme Generator for Social Media
Used stable diffusion to create an interactive meme generation app for marketing campaigns.

## Volatility Forecasting in India
Implemented a GARCH time-series model to forecast stock volatility; integrated with APIs for automated prediction delivery.
