For my masterâ€™s thesis, I developed a Physics-Informed Diffusion-Based Framework for Enhancing Underwater Images in High Turbidity Conditions, combining deep learning with physical modelling to address challenges in marine imaging. I have also published in peer-reviewed venues, including the National Conference on Communications (NCC 2025), where I presented work on the performance of state-of-the-art underwater image enhancement models."
